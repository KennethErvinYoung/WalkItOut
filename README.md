# Walkitout

**This project will build, but missing the majority of it's features**

Walk **it** out is a simplistic pedometer for the iPhone 5S. Using the built in M7 motion chip, motion data for the past 7 days is stored on the device. This application reads the data and interprets it into steps, miles, and calories. 



Stores the users height, weight, and gender to report the steps walked, miles walked, and calories lost per day. 

Uses the built in [CMMotionActivity](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreMotion/Reference/CMMotionActivityManager_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013503). 
Currently working on an open source wrapper to make CMMotion easier to use.
